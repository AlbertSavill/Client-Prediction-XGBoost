Overall it seems the most accurate model is the Light gradient boost Macchine 70/30
From the loan prediction that keeps all attributes and does not get rid of
any with a final score of 94.2%.
It seems the lowest accurate model is the Gradient Boost Classifier 80/20 from
that actually gets rid of the attributes of 'previous', 'emp.var.rate', 'nr.employed', 'euribor3m'
Perhaps in this dataset, the best training/test balance is 70/30, and also best to keep 
all the attributes. The only benefit gaines from getting rid of the correlated attributes
was to discover other attributes that may play an important role of predicting loans to
bank customers, those newly important attributes being cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx and
pdays to consider.
